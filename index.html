            <h1>Rangpur Riders crowned inaugural GSL champions with emphatic 56-run win</h1>
            <h4><i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-days"></i> 5 December, 2024</h4>
            <p>This victory marks a historic moment for Bangladeshi cricket, as Rangpur Riders become the first franchise from the country to win a global title.
        
            Rangpur Riders completed a remarkable turnaround in the Global T20 Super League, becoming the inaugural champions with a commanding 56-run victory over Victoria in Guyana on 7 December.

            After a shaky start to the tournament, losing their first two matches, Rangpur stormed back to claim the title, delivering a performance that showcased their resilience and dominance.
                
            Steven Taylor and Soumya Sarkar laid the foundation with a record 124-run opening partnership, the highest of the tournament.
            Taylor, who started cautiously, unleashed his aggression to score 68 off 49 balls, while Soumya was in scintillating form, smashing 86 off 54 deliveries.

            His knock, filled with stylish leg-side shots and audacious strokes, was the highest individual score of the tournament and propelled Rangpur to 178/3, the highest team total in the competition.

            Victoria, in response, struggled to keep up with Rangpur's disciplined bowling. Mahedy Hasan delivered tight overs, while Kamrul Islam showed his redemption arc with crucial wickets. The pressure from Rangpur's bowlers proved too much for Victoria, who were bundled out well short of the target.

            After a composed start in the Powerplay, where Rangpur scored 40 runs without losing a wicket, StevenTaylor and Soumya Sarkar unleashed a scintillating display in the middle overs.

            Taylor fell to Karima Gore in the 14th over, but Soumya continued his dazzling assault. He smashed seven boundaries and five sixes, showcasing exceptional power hitting and finishing with a commanding knock that set up Rangpur's innings.

            Chasing the target, Victoria began aggressively.

            Joe Clarke's explosive 22-ball 40 gave them early momentum. However, the innings faltered after Clarke fell in the 11th over to Mahedi Hasan. Rangpur's bowlers tightened their grip, leading to a collapse that saw Victoria bowled out for just 122 in 18.1 overs.

            Mahedi was crucial with the ball, taking two wickets for 20 runs in his four overs, while Rishad Hossain also claimed two scalps. Harmeet Singh delivered a stellar spell, finishing with three wickets for 19 runs in four overs.

            Rangpur's path to the final was far from smooth. Player availability became a significant concern as the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) called up Soumya Sarkar, Rishad Hossain, and Afif Hossain for the national team's ODI series against the West Indies, starting on 8 December.

            The franchise faced a race against time to secure their participation in the final before the players' departure to St Kitts.

            Adding to their woes, Mohammad Saifuddin suffered an injury during the must-win match against Lahore Qalandars, casting doubt over his availability.

            Yet, Rangpur's players and management rallied, navigating these obstacles with determination to deliver a performance befitting champions.
